Image-net is an image database organized according to the [http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ WordNet] hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images. It is used in a yearly challenge. The URLs to the images and various meta information is available at:

The PEC dataset contains is used for 'event recognition'. It contains 61364 images (11GB) divided into 807 collections, where each collection is a series of images of the same event. For example, they have 60 collections of 
'birthday' images, where each collection contains about 55 photos of the same birthday party, in the same place, with the same people.

The Dresden dataset is used for camera identification. It contains more than 4,000 images of various indoor and outdoor scenes have been acquired under controlled and thus widely comparable conditions from altogether 73 digital 
cameras. The cameras were drawn from only 25 different models to ensure that device-specific and model-specific characteristics can be disentangled and studied separately.

* http://www.cfreds.nist.gov/Hacking_Case.html 

hosts a few sample cases that may be useful for examiners to practice with.

The Digital Forensic Research Workshop's Rodeos and Challenges released their data and scenario writeups. The following had disk images as parts of their scenario:

Other Corpora
-------------

* Under an NSF grant, Kam Woods and [http://forensicswiki.org/wiki/Simson_Garfinkel Simson Garfinkel] created a website for digital corpora [http://digitalcorpora.org [2]]. The site includes a complete training scenario, including disk images, packet captures and exercises.

* The [http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Main/HomePage UMass Trace Repository] provides network, storage, and other traces to the research community for analysis. The UMass Trace Repository is supported by grant #CNS-323597 from the National Science Foundation.

* UCI's [http://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/resources.php Network Data Repository] provides data sets of a diverse set of networks. Some of the networks are related to computers, some aren't.
